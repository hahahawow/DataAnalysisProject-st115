    "We chose to investigate the data for 12 departments so we could have a good variety. These departments were chosen with regards to data availability, webscraping convenience, and subject diversity as well as considering how they may have different effects on our hypotheses. \n",

    "The first thing to do was inspect the HTML code and group together the websites that have similar enough structure that iterating the same code over the links would produce satisfactory results. By testing out websites and editing the code to make it general enough to work for different links yet still specific enough to collect the required data, we came up with code that would work for the departments of Departments of Social Policy, Anthropology, Finance, Mathematics, Statistics, Psychological and Behavioural Science, and International Relations. The rest of the departments had varying HTML code for their staff website and so tailored approaches for webscraping were required for the departments of Management, Sociology, Geography and Environment, Economic History, and Government. \n",

    "The dataframes for each department contains the staff member's name, department, label, and title. The label is so that we can group each individual as research or non-research based and the title is to investigate whether there is any relevancy to the number of doctors vs. professors vs. neither. \n",

We base it on the label, with more academic type roles as researchers and service/teaching type roles as non-research. There are also a few unique labels such as Public Engagement and Impact which only has one person. To figure these out, we do a quick check of the staff members under these labels and look at what there role entails and whether their page is related to research. So for Public Engagement and Impact, the sole staff member under the label had research listed under their interests and had also published a paper, so we identified them as a researcher. Similar tactics were used for other unique labels."
